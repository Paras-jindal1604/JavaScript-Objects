# 🧠 JavaScript Objects Mastery

This repository is dedicated to mastering how **objects** work in JavaScript — from various creation methods to prototype chaining, object methods, copying strategies, and destructuring. It serves as a detailed reference for developers looking to strengthen their foundation in object-oriented JavaScript.

## 1. 🏗️ Ways to Create Objects

JavaScript provides multiple ways to create objects. These include:

- **Object literals**, the most straightforward way using curly braces.
- **Constructor functions**, which allow reuse with the `new` keyword.
- **The `Object.create()` method**, used for creating a new object with a specified prototype.
- **Classes**, introduced in ES6, which offer a cleaner syntax for constructor functions.
- **Using `new Object()`**, which creates an empty object using the built-in Object constructor.

Each method has its own use case depending on inheritance, reuse, and readability preferences.

## 2. 🛠️ Useful Object Methods

JavaScript's `Object` class provides powerful static methods:

- **`Object.keys()`** – Retrieves an array of an object’s enumerable property names.
- **`Object.values()`** – Returns an array of the object’s values.
- **`Object.entries()`** – Returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs.
- **`Object.assign()`** – Copies values from one or more source objects to a target object.

These methods are fundamental for iterating over and manipulating object properties.

## 3. 🔁 Spread Operator vs. `Object.assign()`

Both the **spread operator (`...`)** and `Object.assign()` are used to copy or merge objects.

- **Spread Operator** offers a concise syntax and can be used directly in object literals.
- **`Object.assign()`** allows more control but has a more verbose syntax.

Both methods create shallow copies, meaning nested objects are still referenced.

---

## 4. 🧪 Shallow vs Deep Copy

- A **shallow copy** duplicates the top-level properties, but nested objects remain shared between the copies.
- A **deep copy** recursively copies all nested levels, creating completely independent duplicates.

Shallow copying methods include spread operator and `Object.assign()`. For deep copies, JSON methods can work but fail with functions, dates, and special types.

---

## 5. 📦 Structured Clone Method

`structuredClone()` is a built-in function introduced to safely create **deep copies** of objects, supporting most types including:

- Objects
- Arrays
- Maps/Sets
- Dates

Unlike JSON methods, `structuredClone()` preserves types and avoids most limitations.

---

## 6. 🧬 Nested Objects and Accessing Keys

Objects can have other objects as values, forming **nested structures**. Accessing values inside nested objects requires chaining keys or using bracket notation.

Deeply nested data structures are common in configurations, APIs, and JSON data. Access can also be dynamically handled using loops or recursion.

---

## 7. 🧷 Object Destructuring

**Destructuring** is a syntax that allows extracting properties from objects into individual variables.

It enhances readability and is especially useful when working with APIs or config files.

- Basic destructuring extracts flat properties.
- **Nested destructuring** allows access to properties deep inside an object structure.

This reduces repetitive access code and improves clarity.

---

## 8. 🔗 Prototype Chaining

JavaScript is prototype-based, and every object has an internal link to a prototype object.

**Prototype chaining** is the process where the engine looks up properties not directly on the object, but in its prototype, then the prototype’s prototype, and so on.

Understanding this concept is essential for grasping inheritance in JavaScript.
